# Prohack-Ouss-M-team
Our solution of the international hackathon Prohack by McKinsey company, we ranked 2nd ( vice champion ).
our team did a vergy good work in this hackathon; we worked hardly during 30 days to get the second place. 

# Prohack :
The hackathon started on May, 18th, 2020 and ended on June 21st 2020. The dataset had around 80 features and few more than 4000 rows (train and test) with 890 rows on test set. We had two tasks: Predict a target variable y which represents the well being index for a galaxy, and a second task where we had to find an optimal allocation of 50k energy units. Score is computed with RMSE metric with 80% for 1st task and 20% for 2nd task.

# Solution : 
in this repo there are  three colab notebook; the first is for data preprocessing, the second is for the model training and evaluation and the last one is for the optimization task.

# our approch : 
we tried to deal with missing values and outliers first and than to scale our data because we used a Deep learning model which is MLP regressor wih catboost model, we took the best 5 results and then we took thier median. 
## we used : 
Pandas, Numpy, SciKit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Catboost, Lightgbm, Xgboost, Mlp regressor.
